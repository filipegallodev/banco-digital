/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `users` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `users` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[username]` on the table `users` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
